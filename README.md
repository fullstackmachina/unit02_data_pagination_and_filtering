🎯 Project Objectives

- Render a list of data dynamically using JavaScript
- Paginate results to improve readability
- Filter data based on user input
- Practice DOM traversal and event delegation
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

📦 Project Requirements

- Display student cards dynamically using JavaScript
- Show 9 students per page
- Create pagination buttons based on dataset size
- Update displayed students when a pagination button is clicked
- Use event delegation to handle pagination interactions

⭐ Extra Credit Features

- Dynamically generated search component (created entirely with JavaScript)
- Case-insensitive search with partial matching
- Real-time filtering as the user types
- Pagination updates dynamically based on search results
- Display a “No results found” message when no matches are returned



🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

- Tested pagination across all pages
- Verified search functionality with:
    * partial matches
    * uppercase/lowercase input
    * empty results
- Monitored Chrome DevTools console for errors
- Ensured consistent indentation and clean code structure
- Replaced starter comments with meaningful explanations

🧠 What I Learned

- How to calculate dynamic start and end indexes for pagination
- DOM manipulation using insertAdjacentHTML
- Event delegation for dynamically created elements
- Filtering arrays of objects based on user input
- Reusing functions to avoid code duplication
